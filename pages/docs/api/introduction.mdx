On April, SixCord and cachejs organization decided to merge to create a better package module to cache static files/pages, here's an example:

## JavaScript

```jsx
import sixcord from 'sixcord.js'
import cache from 'sixcord.js/cache'
  
CACHE_FILES [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  /main.css'
  ]

sixcord.cache('work', () => {
  console.log(`Caching files ${cache_files}`
```
